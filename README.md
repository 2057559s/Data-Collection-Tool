# Data Collection Management Tool

The main purpose of the research was to develop a data collection management tool, which would enable researchers to analyse and observe such datasets. The datasets come from user logs of current deployed apps, and are initially streams of data, which can come in many forms. The data tool follows a web-based interface where researchers can input a raw data set and immediately start transforming the data.
